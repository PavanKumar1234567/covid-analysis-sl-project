<p style="color:black;font-size:18px;">
    The coronavirus from China has spread globally since January 2020 and has become a pandemic.
This project aims in finding the top3 most effected 
countries over the globe based on cumulative cases and deaths gathered from the dataset.<br>
</p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;"><u>Top3 most effected countries:</u></p>

<p style="color:black;font-size:18px;">
This graph was a cumulative 
line plot of 3 lines corresponding to top3 countries.The top three most effected 
countries are USA,INDIA,BRAZIL 
respectively.On the x-axis we have taken different dates across the 2 year pandemic period 
and on y-axis cummulative deaths across these 2 years.After plotting we
got below graph.We can observe USA curve is above India eventhough India population is high.

Covid Pandemic stayed around 2 years,so we divide it into 4 parts
[Jan 2020-Jun2020,July2020-Dec2020,Jan2021-June2021,July2021-Dec2021] 
and plotted 3 pie plots corresponding to 3 countries to find which time 
period has most covid cases.In USA most deaths
happend in the time period July2021-Dec2021.

<p style="color:black;font-size:22px; font-family: Courier;"><u>USA and BRAZIL Male and Female death ratio:</u></p>
<p style="color:black;font-size:18px;">
Eventhough USA has more deaths than BRAZIL, the male and female death ratio is almost same,
this shows covid has approximately same effect on males and females eventhough most male 
people go out for work purpose or buy basic needs etc.

<p style="color:black;font-size:22px; font-family: Courier;"><u>Top3 most effected states:</u></p>
<p style="color:black;font-size:18px;">
    Below is a cumulative line curve of most affected 3 states in India.
    This graph ilustrates that Maharashtra's curve is 
    considerably at high position than Kerala and Karnataka.Kerala and Karnataka were approximately on same page.
    Maharashtra has second most highest population in India,
    and this can be a factor which could explain the curve.

    the highest fracton of deaths due to covid.
    In kerala it is May to August in the year 2021.
    Also Kerala has less deaths in the period March 2020 to June 2020.
    It shows Kerala was not that effected in initial Phases
    of covid but later it has increased.

<p style="color:black;font-size:22px; font-family: Courier;"><u>Deaths in Maharastra between 2020-2021:</u></p>
<p style="color:black;font-size:18px;">
    In Maharashtra as we can see half of its total deaths due to covid have happend in 
    same period as remaining states 
    that is May 2021 to August 2021 .
    The other half of the deaths were some what evenly distributed across remaining 3 time periods .
    This shows Maharashtra has been facing deaths due to covid from the beginning of the pandemic .
    The huge population and the conjusted streets might be a factor of its wide spread of covid virus.
