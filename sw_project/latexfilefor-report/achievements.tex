\section{Conclusions on spread of covid over globe}
The top 3 most affected countries due to covid according to our dataset are \\
1.USA(United States of America)\\
2.India\\
3.Brazil\\
Eventhough the population of India is higher than USA,USA has considerably more number of deaths than India,this shows that USA has clearly failed in its countermeasures to restrict the covid spread,this is inferred from the cumulative line plot of the 3 cuntries.\\
From the pie plots of the 3 countries across 4 time periods in the 2 years 2020 and 2021 [2020-Jun2020,July2020-Dec2020,Jan2021-June2021,July2021-Dec2021].All of these 3 coutries have shown some similar trend in these pie plots.\\
These 3 countries have seen more of its deaths due to covid in the year 2021 with slight variations upto mid 2021 and towards the end of 2021.\\
A)USA have most of its deaths due to covid in the time period post July 2021\\
B)India has most of its deaths due to covid in the time period Jan 2021 to June 2021\\
C)Brazil has most of its deaths due to covid in the time period Jan 2021 to June 2021 ,infact more than 50 percent of its deaths occured in this time period for Brazil.

\section{Conclusions on ratio of male and female deaths due to covid}
The bar graph that we plotted for death percentages of males and females of USA and Brazil shows that death ratios of USA and Brazil were approximately same.But males were around 55percent while females were around 45 percent this may be because population of males was higher than females also men tend to be exposed to outer world for jobs,buy grocesseries etc.\\

\section{Conclusions on spread of covid in India}
The top 3 most affected states in India due to covid according to our dataset based on the number of deaths in the period 2020 to 2021.\\
1.Maharashtra\\
2.Karnataka\\
3.Kerala\\
The first graph which has cumulative line curves of 3 states illustrates that Maharashtra has its curve in a bit higher position than Kerala and Karnataka.Maharastra 
has more deaths compared to Kerala and Karnataka.Maharashtra has second most highest population in India, and this can be a factor which could explain the curve.\\

In Maharashtra as we can see half of its total deaths due to covid have happend in same period as remaining states that is May 2021 to August 2021 . The other half of the deaths were some what evenly distributed across remaining 3 time periods . This shows Maharashtra has been facing deaths due to covid from the beginning of the pandemic . The huge population and the conjusted streets might be a factor of its wide spread of covid virus.\\
Karnataka also has similar trend and has most of its death in the time period May 2021 to August 2021. In the rest of the 3 time periods also it has considerable amounts of deaths .\\
In kerala it is May to August in the year 2021. Also Kerala has less deaths in the period March 2020 to June 2020. It shows Kerala was not that effected in initial Phases of covid but later it has increased.\\
